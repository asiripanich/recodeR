Title: Recode Variables in A Data Frame With A Pre-Defined Mapping Table
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Amarin Siripanich
Maintainer: Amarin Siripanich <amarin@dymium.org>
Description:
    The goal of recodeR is to make recoding super easy when you have a pre-defined mapping table. 
    I often found myself using the dplyr::case_when function in data prepation and it can look super 
    messy real fast when you have a lot of categories to be recoded. Hence, recodeR was born!
